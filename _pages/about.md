I am currently a Research Fellow at the College of Computer Science, Inner Mongolia University. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2025 from Beijing Institute of Technology, where I was advised by [Assoc. Prof. Song Yang](https://songyang-cs.github.io/). During my Ph.D. studies, I was also a visiting student at National University of Singapore advised by [Assoc. Prof. Richard T. B. Ma](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tbma/). I obtained my M.Sc. degree in 2021 and my B.Sc. degree in 2018, both from the College of Computer Science, Inner Mongolia University, under the supervision of [Prof. Junxing Zhang](https://ccs.imu.edu.cn/info/1020/1846.htm). 

**Research interests**: networked systems.   
My research applies state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to significantly improve the performance and reliability of large-scale networked systems. In particular, my work bridges software and hardware, aiming to enhance video streaming performance through innovative algorithm design.

**Hiring**  
I am looking for highly motivated Master, and undergraduate students with strong background in CS, EE and Math.
