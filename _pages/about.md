I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Beijing Institute of Technology advised by [Prof. Song Yang](https://songyang-cs.github.io/). Currently, I am also a visiting student at National University of Singapore advised by [Prof. Richard T. B. Ma](https://richard-ma.netlify.app/). I completed my M.Sc. and undergraduate at Inner Mongolia University in 2021, under [Prof. Junxing Zhang](https://ccs.imu.edu.cn/info/1166/2829.htm)â€™s advisor. 

Research interests: networked systems. My research applies state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to drastically improve the performance and reliability of large-scale networked systems. My work bridges the gap between software and hardware, aiming to enhance video streaming system performance through innovative algorithm design.
